### Manual download

This is the worst case scenario. This will be needed if one needs to generate a link to download the data files. An example of this can be found [here](https://data.humancellatlas.org/explore/projects/efea6426-510a-4b60-9a19-277e52bfa815).  There is not much that we can do other than defining basic aspects of the data loading and metadata. 

The data source entry is important because it will provide the url for the downloading of the files. The comment is relevant to provide additional information on how to download and store the files (this is particularly useful if this data will be downloaded by other people in the future).
