To understand how to load GEO data, one needs to know its format. To do so, you can download one of the files and figure it out for yourself. If there is only two files, it is not a bad idea to check both. 

Similarly, if one only defines the format for the protein, the app will assume that the format for the RNA and HTO data is the same. One might one to consider if this is actually true by checking all the different data types.
