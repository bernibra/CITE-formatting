### Direct download

With this option, every file needs to be downloaded directly. Provide a unique id to the dataset, and upload the necessary files. Metadata files are optional. Protein, RNA and HTO data are provided separately. If all files come in a single file, use only the protein data field.

Note that one important variable when specifying the files to be downloaded is the 'grouping factor'. This allows you to specify files that need to be processed together. Imagine for example, that samples come separately in different files, and that each sample has three files&mdash;e.g. 'matrix.mtx', 'featres.csv', and 'barcodes.csv'. The grouping factor, allows you to match the files based on the name you gave them. For example, when entering the files for say 'sample 1', you can specify the names as: 'S1_matrix.mtx', 'S1_featres.csv', and 'S1_barcodes.csv'. Then, you can use 'S1' as your grouping factor to specify that these three names need to be processed together. If samples come in separate files but there is only one file per sample, there is no need to specify a grouping factor.
