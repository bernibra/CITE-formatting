### GEO download

GEO data sources are tricky because there are many variables in how the files are structured and formatted.

The first important thing is providing a valid GEO id. This will also be used as the datafile id, so it has to be unique. Then, one can download GEO data using the R package GEOquery or by directly providing the relevant url links. 

If you choose using the GEOquery software, the app will download the metadata and will attempt to filter out the different files.
