### `data/databases` files

This app will generate a yaml file, which will give instructions to the CITE-wrangling pipeline on how to download and process a given dataset. There are multiple data sources&mdash;GEOquery, ArrayExpress, direct downloads, etc&mdash;and there is essential information that one needs to provide to work with each data source. Note that if the data download cannot be automated (e.g. because it requires login), you should use the 'manual download' option, where one can give specific instructions to future  users on how to download the files.

Each dataset/experiment is defined by a unique identifier that defines in turn the name of the corresponding yaml file. For some datasets this is obtained from the accession key. Other datasets, however, will use the alias as a unique identifier. For the 'unique alias', one should double-check that this [is not in the pipeline already](https://github.com/bernibra/CITE-wrangling/blob/main/data/list-of-papers.csv). The other entries are mostly straightforward at this point, with entries such as 'tissue' or 'species'. However, make sure that you write a concise but comprehensive description for this dataset, including the number of samples, treatments and data types (as well as any singularities of the data that are not covered already by the other entry fields).
